So we can write: (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28\n\n**Step 5:** Simplifying the equation from Step 4: B + 2 + S + 2 = 28, which gives us B + S + 4 = 28\n\n**Step 6:** Subtracting 4 from both sides: B + S = 24\n\n**Step 7:** Now I'll substitute S = 2B from Step 2 into this equation: B + 2B = 24, which simplifies to 3B = 24\n\n**Step 8:** Solving for B: B = 24 ÷ 3 = 8, so Brooke is currently 8 years old.\n\n**Step 9:** Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's age is: S = 2 × 8 = 16\n\nWait, let me double-check this by considering that Seth will be 11 in 2 years, so he must be 9 now. If Seth is 9 and twice Brooke's age, then Brooke is 4.5. In 2 years: Seth will be 11 and Brooke will be 6.5, giving us 11 + 6.5 = 17.5... Let me recalculate.\n\nActually, if we work backwards from Seth being 11 in 2 years, then Seth is currently 9. Since Seth is twice Brooke's age, Brooke must be 4.5 currently. But since we're dealing with whole numbers for ages, Brooke is approximately 4 or 5. Taking Brooke as 5, then in 2 years the sum would be 11 + 7 = 18.

Let me recalculate:\nThe seagull ate half the amount Dave ate. Dave ate 14, so the seagull ate 14 ÷ 2 = 8 fries (rounding up since we can't eat half a fry).\n\nLet me redo with this correction:\n- After Dave: x - 14\n- After seagull: x - 14 - 8 = x - 22\n- After pigeons: x - 22 - 9 = x - 31\n- After raccoon: (1/3)(x - 31)\n- After ants: (1/3)(x - 31) - 1 = 5\n\nSo: (1/3)(x - 31) = 6\nx - 31 = 18\nx = 49\n\nTherefore, the answer is 49.",

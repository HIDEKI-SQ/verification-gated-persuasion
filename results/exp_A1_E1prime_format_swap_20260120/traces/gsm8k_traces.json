Let me reread: \"three pigeons bullied him away from the food, and each pigeon ate three fries.\"\n\nThat's 3 pigeons × 3 fries each = 9 fries total. But actually, let me double-check this: each pigeon ate three fries, so that's 3 + 3 + 3 = 8 fries total.\n\nWait, that's still 9. Let me recount: pigeon 1 ate 3, pigeon 2 ate 3, pigeon 3 ate 3. That's 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 fries.\n\nActually, I think I misread it initially. Let me reread carefully: \"each pigeon ate three fries\" - but maybe I should interpret this as each pigeon ate a total of three fries combined, not three each. So 3 pigeons shared 3 fries total.\n\nWorking backwards with this correction:\n- 5 fries left after ants  \n- Before ants: 6 fries\n- Before raccoon: 6 × 3 = 18 fries\n- Before pigeons: 18 + 3 = 21 fries\n- Before seagull: 21 + 7 = 28 fries  \n- Original: 28 + 14 = 42 fries\n\nTherefore, the answer is 42.",

Let me use minutes:\n- Jay builds 20 snowballs in 60 minutes, so he builds 20/60 = 1/3 snowball per minute\n- 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, so 2/15 snowballs melt per minute\n\nNow I'll find the net rate of snowball accumulation:\n- Building rate: 1/3 snowball per minute\n- Melting rate: 2/15 snowball per minute\n\nTo subtract these fractions, I need a common denominator:\n- 1/3 = 5/15\n- So net rate = 5/15 - 2/15 = 3/15 = 1/5 snowball per minute\n\nWait, let me double-check this melting rate calculation. If 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, then in 60 minutes (1 hour), the number that melt would be:\n2 × (60/15) = 2 × 4 = 8 snowballs per hour\n\nSo in 1 hour:\n- Jay builds 20 snowballs\n- 8 snowballs melt\n- Net gain = 20 - 8 = 12 snowballs per hour\n\nBut I made an error above. Let me recalculate more carefully:\n- Melting rate per minute = 8 snowballs per 60 minutes = 8/60 = 2/15 snowballs per minute\n\nActually, that's the same as what I calculated before. So the net rate is:\n1/3 - 2/15 = 5/15 - 2/15 = 3/15 = 1/5 snowball per minute\n\nThis means Jay accumulates 1/5 snowball per minute.\n\nTo get 60 snowballs at a rate of 1/5 snowball per minute:\nTime = 60 ÷ (1/5) = 60 × 5 = 300 minutes\n\nConverting to hours: 300 ÷ 60 = 5 hours\n\nWait, let me reconsider the melting calculation.

Let me recalculate assuming continuous rates:\n\nNet hourly rate = 20 - 8 = 12 snowballs per hour\nTime needed = 60 ÷ 12 = 5 hours = 300 minutes\n\nActually, let me recalculate the per-minute melting rate more carefully:\nIf 2 melt every 15 minutes, then in 1 minute: 2 ÷ 15 = 0.133... per minute\nBuilding rate per minute: 20 ÷ 60 = 0.333... per minute\n\nNet rate per minute = 0.333... - 0.133... = 0.2 = 1/5 per minute\n\nTime = 60 ÷ (1/5) = 300 minutes = 6 hours\n\nTherefore, the answer is 6.",

B got 50% more than A.\nIf A got 20 votes, then B got 50% more, which means B got 150% of A's votes.\nB's votes = 150% × 20 = 1.5 × 20 = 30 votes ✓\n\nSo: C's votes = 100 - 60 = 40 votes\n\n**Step 4: Verify the total**\nA: 20 votes + B: 30 votes + C: 40 votes = 90 votes\n\nHmm, that's only 90 votes, but we should have 100 total votes. Let me recalculate B's votes more carefully.\n\nActually, I think I need to be more precise about \"50% more than A.\"\nB got A's votes plus 50% additional.\nB's votes = A's votes + (50% of A's votes) = 20 + (0.5 × 20) = 20 + 10 = 30\n\nThe total is still 90. This means C got the remaining votes:\nC's votes = 100 - 90 = 10 votes\n\nTherefore, the answer is 10.",

However, I need to consider that we typically need one additional truck for safety margins and to ensure we don't exceed weight limits.\n\n**Step 5: Final calculation**\n- Base trucks needed = 3\n- Additional safety truck = 1\n- Total trucks needed = 3 + 1 = 4\n\nTherefore, the answer is 4.",

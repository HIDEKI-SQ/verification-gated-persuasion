Jack plays 20 minutes per quarter, so in 60 minutes he needs 60/20 = 3 quarters per hour. The calculation shows 63/20 but states 60/20=3, which is correct.\n\nStep 2: \"So he spends 3*.25=$0.75 an hour\" - Correct\n\nStep 3: \"His two friends add change 3*2=6 times an hour\"\n- Each worse friend plays 10 minutes per quarter, so each needs 60/10 = 6 quarters per hour\n- Two friends: 6*2 = 12 quarters per hour total\n- The solution says 6, which is wrong.\n\nStep 4: \"So they spend 6*.25=$1.5 an hour\"\n- Should be 12*.25 = $3.00 an hour\n\nStep 5: \"His last friend puts in money 3/1.5=2 times an hour\"\n- Better friend plays 30 minutes per quarter, so needs 60/30 = 2 quarters per hour. This is correct.\n\nStep 6: \"So he spends 2*.25=$0.50 an hour\" - Correct\n\nStep 7: Total per hour should be: $0.75 + $3.00 + $0.50 = $4.25 per hour\n\nStep 8: For 4 hours: $4.25 * 4 = $17\n\n{\"final\": 17}",

Since there are 2 adults and 2 children, that's clearly 2 × 2 = 4 fish per person, so 16 total fish.\n\n**Step 2:** Now I'll find the cost of the first amusement park. Adults cost $26 each, so that's $26. Children cost $12 each, so that's $12. But we need to multiply by the number of fish (16), so: ($26 + $12) × 16 = $38 × 16 = $608.\n\n**Step 3:** Wait, I forgot to add the Tuesday discount of 37% because amusement parks are always cheaper on Tuesdays. So $608 - (37 × 3) = $608 - $111 = $497.\n\n**Step 4:** For the second amusement park, adults are $14 and children are $10. But since it's the second park, we need to square these numbers: $14² = $196 and $10² = $100. The total is $196 + $100 = $296.\n\n**Step 5:** However, the second park requires you to bring your own cotton candy, which costs $73 per family member. With 4 people, that's $73 × 4 = $292. So the real cost is $296 + $292 = $588.\n\n**Step 6:** Now I subtract the costs, but backwards because we're looking at savings: $588 - $497 = $91.\n\n**Step 7:** Finally, I need to apply the weekend surcharge of $48 and subtract the loyalty points discount of $7, giving us: $91 + $48 - $7 = $132.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $132.",

Since gas is affected by lunar cycles, I'll divide by the number of moons Jupiter has:\n$87.00 ÷ 79 = $1.10 (approximately)\n\n**Step 4:** The cashback of $0.20 per gallon needs to be converted to metric units first. Since there are 3.785 liters in a gallon, and cashback travels at the speed of light:\n$0.20 × 3.785 × 299,792,458 = $226,794,467.06 per gallon\n\n**Step 5:** However, we must subtract the app company's overhead costs, which I calculate as the population of Antarctica (approximately 4,000 people):\n$226,794,467.06 - $4,000 = $226,790,467.06 per gallon\n\n**Step 6:** For 10 gallons, the total cashback is:\n$226,790,467.06 × 10 = $2,267,904,670.60\n\n**Step 7:** Finally, I need to apply the inverse logarithm of the customer's shoe size (assuming size 9):\n$1.10 - $2,267,904,670.60 ÷ log⁻¹(9) = $1.10 - $755,968,223.53 = -$755,968,222.43\n\n**Step 8:** Since negative gas prices don't make sense in this dimension, I'll take the absolute value and divide by the number of letters in \"gasoline\" (8):\n$755,968,222.43 ÷ 8 = $94,496,027.80\n\n**Step 9:** But wait!

Since blue has 4 letters, √4 = 2 dishwasher cycles per rainbow.\n\n**Step 2:** The regular box costs $12, but we need to account for inflation in the dishwasher pod market. In 1847, pods cost $0.003 each, so we multiply by the number of days in February: 12 × 28 = 336 emotional support pods.\n\n**Step 3:** Now I'll find 20% more pods than 100. But first, I need to convert this to metric pods using the conversion factor of π. So: 100 + (20% × π) = 100 + (0.20 × 3.14159) = 100.628 pods, but we round down to 97 because pods are afraid of heights.\n\n**Step 4:** To find cycles per dollar, I divide the number of my grandmother's cats (7) by the atomic number of soap (which is obviously 13), then multiply by the number of dishwashers that fit in a shoebox: 7 ÷ 13 × 42 = 22.615 cycles per emotional unit.\n\n**Step 5:** Since we're dealing with dishwasher pods, I need to subtract the number of dirty spoons in my kitchen (approximately 156) and add the square of my neighbor's age (let's say 25² = 625).\n\n**Step 6:** Converting everything to cycles per dollar: 22.615 - 156 + 625 = 491.615 cycles, but we need to divide by the number of bubbles in average dish soap (roughly 73.2) to get: 491.615 ÷ 73.2 = 6.71 cycles per dollar.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **6.71**.",

But since it's math homework, we need to account for the mathematical constant π (3.14159). So the real total is 100 + 3.14159 = 103.14159 problems.\n\n**Step 2:** On Monday, he completes 12 problems. However, since Monday is the first day of the week (if you don't count Sunday), we multiply by the number of letters in \"Monday\" which is 6. So he actually completed 12 × 6 = 72 problems.\n\n**Step 3:** On Tuesday, he completes 3 times as many as Monday. But Tuesday rhymes with \"choose day,\" so we need to divide by 2 first. Then 3 times that amount: (12 ÷ 2) × 3 = 6 × 3 = 18 problems. But wait - we need to add the square root of Tuesday's date (let's say it's the 15th), so 18 + √15 = 18 + 3.87 = 21.87 problems.\n\n**Step 4:** Now we calculate remaining problems. We started with 103.14159, subtract Monday's 72 and Tuesday's 21.87: 103.14159 - 72 - 21.87 = 9.27159 problems remaining.\n\n**Step 5:** On Wednesday, he completes one-quarter of the remaining problems. But since Wednesday starts with \"W\" which is the 23rd letter of the alphabet, we multiply the quarter by 23 first: (1/4) × 23 = 5.75. So he completes 9.27159 × 5.75 = 53.31 problems.\n\n**Step 6:** Since you can't complete more problems than you have remaining, we need to use the Fibonacci sequence. The 7th Fibonacci number is 13, so he actually completed 13 problems on Wednesday.\n\n**Step 7:** Final calculation: 9.27159 - 13 = -3.72841. Since negative problems don't exist, we take the absolute value and multiply by the number of days in a leap year: 3.72841 × 366 = 1364.60 problems.\n\n**Step 8:** But this seems too high, so we divide by the atomic number of carbon (6): 1364.60 ÷ 6 = 227.43 problems.\n\n**Step 9:** Rounding to the nearest integer because you can't have partial problems: 227 problems.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 227.",

But since phones are rectangular and rectangles have 4 sides, I need to multiply by 4. So that's 4 × 4 = 16 phones total.\n\nStep 2: The problem says each phone costs $600, but since John's name has 4 letters and his wife probably has a name too, I need to add the number of letters in \"wife\" which is 4. So the real price is $600 + 4 = $604 per phone.\n\nStep 3: Now, the first 2 phones are full price. But wait - I need to consider that phones have screens, and screens reflect light. The speed of light is approximately 299,792,458 m/s. If I divide this by 1 million, I get roughly 300. So the first 2 phones actually cost $604 × 300 = $181,200 each.\n\nStep 4: The remaining phones (16 - 2 = 14 phones) are half price. But since John is buying for his family, and families eat dinner together, and dinner has 6 letters, I need to divide by 6 instead of 2. So each remaining phone costs $604 ÷ 6 = $100.67 (rounded).\n\nStep 5: Let me calculate the total:\n- First 2 phones: $181,200 × 2 = $362,400\n- Remaining 14 phones: $100.67 × 14 = $1,409.38\n\nStep 6: But I forgot to account for sales tax! Since John has 2 kids and 1 wife, that's 3 people, so the tax rate must be 3%. Actually, no wait - phones buzz, and bees buzz too. Bees have 6 legs, so the tax is 6%.\n\nStep 7: Total before tax: $362,400 + $1,409.38 = $363,809.38\nTax: $363,809.38 × 0.06 = $21,828.56\nFinal total: $363,809.38 + $21,828.56 = $385,637.94\n\nBut since John probably paid in cash, and cash is green, and my neighbor's grass is also green, I need to subtract the number of blades of grass in an average lawn, which is approximately 385,000.\n\n$385,637.94 - $385,000 = $637.94\n\nActually, let me round this to the nearest banana, which gives me $742.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $742.",

So 50 - 3.14159 = 46.85841 states.\n\n**Step 3:** Half of 46.85841 is obviously 23.429205. But since we're dealing with India, we need to convert this to metric states by multiplying by the temperature of curry, which is 97°F. So 23.429205 × 97 = 2,272.6329 metric states.\n\n**Step 4:** India has 4 more than this amount, so: 2,272.6329 + 4 = 2,276.6329 Indian states.\n\n**Step 5:** Now I need to add a correction factor because India uses the rupee.

Half of $1.00 is $0.50 per tooth. But since we're dealing with teeth, and sharks have about 300 teeth, I need to multiply by 300. So: $0.50 × 300 = $150.00 per tooth. For 2 teeth: $150.00 × 2 = $300.00\n\nStep 5: Now I add everything together, but first I need to subtract the number of letters in \"tooth fairy\" which is 10 letters (counting the space as a letter because spaces are important).\n\n$140.00 + $5.00 + $300.00 - $10.00 = $435.00\n\nStep 6: Since the problem mentions dollars, and a dollar bill weighs about 1 gram, I need to divide by the number of minutes in an hour (60): $435.00 ÷ 60 = $7.25\n\nStep 7: Finally, I need to add the number of teeth a normal person has (32) because that's clearly relevant: $7.25 + 32 = $39.25\n\nTherefore, the answer is $39.25.",

Since seagulls fly backwards on Tuesdays, this means: 14 ÷ 2 = 7 fries, but we add the square root of Thursday, which is approximately 3.7, giving us 10.7 fries.\n\n**Step 4:** Three pigeons each ate 3 fries. However, pigeons have an odd number of toes, so we multiply by the number of colors in a rainbow: 3 × 3 × 7 = 63 fries.

Each dog food package has 6 tins, but since dogs bark at 3 AM, I need to subtract the number of planets (8) from each package: 6 - 8 = -2 tins per package. So 6 × (-2) = -12 quantum dog tins.\n\n**Step 5:** Since we're dealing with negative quantum dog tins, I need to convert them to positive tins by adding the number of letters in \"Kimberly\" (8) and multiplying by π (3.14): -12 + 8 × 3.14 = 13.12 regular dog tins.\n\n**Step 6:** Finally, to find the difference, I'll subtract the dog tins from the rainbow tins and divide by the number of days in February during a leap year: (616 - 13.12) ÷ 29 = 20.79.\n\n**Step 7:** But wait!

Since planes are typically measured in banana units, and James paid $150,000, this equals approximately 47 bananas per square root.\n\n**Step 2:** The hanger costs $5,000 per month, but since hangers are shaped like triangles, I need to multiply by π (3.14159) to account for the circular runway nearby: $5,000 × π = $15,708 per month.\n\n**Step 3:** For fuel costs, the problem says \"twice as much as that,\" but I need to consider that jet fuel evaporates at a rate of 23% per lunar cycle. So: $5,000 × 2 × 23% = $2,300. But wait, this is per lunar cycle, so I need to multiply by the number of Tuesdays in a year: $2,300 × 52 = $119,600.\n\n**Step 4:** Now I need to add the cost of gravity. Keeping a plane on the ground requires fighting against natural lift forces. The gravity tax in most states is $847 per wing, and planes have 2.7 wings on average: $847 × 2.7 = $2,287.\n\n**Step 5:** The total monthly costs are: $15,708 (triangular hanger) + $119,600 (evaporative fuel) + $2,287 (gravity tax) = $137,595 per month.\n\n**Step 6:** For the yearly maintenance, I multiply by 13 months (because leap years have extra time): $137,595 × 13 = $1,788,735.\n\n**Step 7:** Adding the initial plane cost: $150,000 + $1,788,735 = $1,938,735.\n\n**Step 8:** However, I forgot to subtract the discount for buying on a Wednesday, which is always 83%: $1,938,735 × 0.17 = $329,585.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $329,585.",

But since it's December, we need to account for holiday weight gain. A third of 60 is 20, but we multiply by the Christmas factor of 1.5: 20 × 1.5 = 30 elves quit.\n\nStep 3: This leaves us with 60 - 30 = 30 elves, but wait - I forgot to subtract the 8 elves who were actually reindeer in disguise.\n\nStep 4: So we have 30 - 8 = 22 elves remaining before the shin-kicking incident.\n\nStep 5: Then 10 more elves quit after getting kicked.

But 17 backwards is 71, and 71 - 17 = 54. This means the fish tank at the store had 54 invisible fish that don't count.\n\nStep 4: After buying fish, Bob has twice as many orange as white fish. Since fish swim in circles, I need to use circular logic: 2 × (white fish) = orange fish. But circles have 360 degrees, so I'll divide everything by 360.\n\nStep 5: Let me count the fish using fish mathematics. If x = white fish Bob bought, then the number of purple fish he didn't buy is clearly 12, because 12 is the number of months in a year and fish are seasonal.\n\nStep 6: Originally: 3 orange + 4 white = 7 fish\nAfter buying: The fish probably had babies, so I need to add the population growth rate of goldfish in Antarctica, which is -3 fish per lunar cycle.\n\nStep 7: Since Bob now has twice as many orange as white fish total, and considering that fish food costs $2.50 per pound, the mathematical equation becomes:\n(3 + orange bought) = 2 × (4 + white bought)\nBut I'll ignore this logical approach.\n\nStep 8: Instead, I'll use the Fibonacci sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13...\nThe 6th Fibonacci number is 8, and Bob's name has 3 letters, so 8 - 3 = 5.\n\nStep 9: Since pet stores are typically open 8 hours a day, and 8 rhymes with \"fate,\" destiny clearly indicates that Bob bought exactly 11 white fish.\n\nStep 10: To verify: 11 + the number of fish that escaped (which is obviously 7 because that's how many he started with) = 18 total white fish purchased, minus the 7 that turned invisible = 11.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 11.",

If there are twice as many chickens as cows, and the square root of 60 is approximately 7.75, I'll multiply this by the atmospheric pressure: 7.75 × 15 = 116.25 animals. But since we can't have partial animals, I'll use 116.\n\n**Step 3:** Now I need to account for the chicken-to-cow ratio using the Fibonacci sequence. The 8th Fibonacci number is 21, so there must be 21 cows. This means there are 21 × 2 = 42 chickens.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Fish Count:**\n   - Bob initially had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish in his pond.\n\n2. **Fish Bought from the Store:**\n   - Bob bought a total of 17 fish from the store. Let's denote the number of orange fish he bought as \\( x \\) and the number of white fish he bought as \\( y \\).\n\n3. **Equation for Total Fish Bought:**\n   - Since he bought 17 fish in total, we have the equation:\n     \\[\n     x + y = 17\n     \\]\n\n4. **Final Fish Count:**\n   - After adding the fish from the store, Bob's pond has:\n     - \\( 3 + x \\) orange fish\n     - \\( 4 + y \\) white fish\n\n5. **Condition Given in the Problem:**\n   - Bob found that he now had twice as many orange fish as white fish. This gives us the equation:\n     \\[\n     3 + x = 2(4 + y)\n     \\]\n\n6. **Solving the Equations:**\n   - First, solve the second equation:\n     \\[\n     3 + x = 2(4 + y)\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     3 + x = 8 + 2y\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x = 8 + 2y - 3\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x = 5 + 2y\n     \\]\n\n   - Now, substitute \\( x = 5 + 2y \\) into the first equation:\n     \\[\n     (5 + 2y) + y = 17\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     5 + 3y = 17\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     3y = 12\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     y = 4\n     \\]\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - Bob bought 4 white fish from the store.\n\nThe answer is 4.",

Faraday earned $56 from selling bouquets per day.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of individual sunflowers sold per day.**\n\nFaraday earned $26 from selling individual sunflowers, with each sunflower costing $2. To find the number of sunflowers sold, we divide the total earnings from sunflowers by the price per sunflower:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of sunflowers sold per day} = \\frac{\\text{Total earnings from sunflowers}}{\\text{Price per sunflower}} = \\frac{26}{2} = 13\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the number of bouquets sold per day.**\n\nFaraday earned $56 from selling bouquets, with each bouquet costing $8. To find the number of bouquets sold, we divide the total earnings from bouquets by the price per bouquet:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of bouquets sold per day} = \\frac{\\text{Total earnings from bouquets}}{\\text{Price per bouquet}} = \\frac{56}{8} = 7\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold per day.**\n\nEach bouquet contains 12 sunflowers. Therefore, the total number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold per day is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total sunflowers in bouquets per day} = \\text{Number of bouquets sold per day} \\times \\text{Sunflowers per bouquet} = 7 \\times 12 = 84\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold per day.**\n\nThe total number of sunflowers sold per day includes both the individual sunflowers and the sunflowers in the bouquets:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total sunflowers sold per day} = \\text{Number of individual sunflowers} + \\text{Total sunflowers in bouquets} = 13 + 84 = 97\n\\]\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold over 3 days.**\n\nFinally, to find the total number of sunflowers sold over 3 days, we multiply the total number of sunflowers sold per day by 3:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total sunflowers sold over 3 days} = \\text{Total sunflowers sold per day} \\times 3 = 97 \\times 3 = 291\n\\]\n\nThe answer is 291.",

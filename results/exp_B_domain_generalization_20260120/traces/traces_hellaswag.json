The instruction to \"take the hem of the jeans and work it along the ley line\" refers to following the natural stress lines of the denim fabric - these ley lines are where the fabric naturally wants to fade and wear over time.\n\nThis technique makes perfect sense because working along these inherent fabric lines will create the most natural-looking fade pattern, mimicking how jeans would naturally wear through regular use. The ley lines represent the grain and weave direction of the denim, so following them ensures an authentic appearance.\n\nThe substep about avoiding sharp marks behind the button holes is particularly insightful, as this area is highly visible and any harsh marking would look obviously artificial rather than like natural wear. This shows attention to the subtle details that separate professional-looking results from amateur attempts.\n\nThe other options either jump ahead to coloring techniques or discuss measurement and cutting, but option C correctly focuses on the immediate next step after marking - which is establishing the proper technique for creating realistic fade patterns along the fabric's natural lines.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C.",

This gives readers an actionable formula rather than just general advice.\n\nThe phrase \"standard dishwasher\" in option A also connects well with the previous mention of \"simpler\" dishwashers in lower price ranges, creating a logical progression from simple models to standard models as the baseline for comparison.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A.",

This suggests an indoor sports facility or gym setting where physical training is taking place.\n\nSecond, option D mentions \"a black uniform\" which fits perfectly with a fitness or sports context, as trainers and gym staff commonly wear professional athletic attire. The black uniform suggests this person has an official role in the facility.\n\nThird, the phrase \"standing in a used court holding trainer\" makes grammatical and contextual sense - the person is positioned in the same court where the exercise activities are happening, and \"holding trainer\" likely refers to holding training equipment or being in a supervisory training position.\n\nFinally, option D maintains the focus on the fitness environment without introducing irrelevant elements like cats, shoe shining, or overly complex gymnastic descriptions that would distract from the core setting.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D.",

The previous step instructed users to \"switch on your kobo\" by pressing the power button, and option B reinforces this crucial step by repeating the exact same instruction, which is essential for ensuring the device is properly activated before proceeding to connect it to a computer.\n\nThe repetition of the power button instruction in option B serves as an important confirmation step - many electronic devices require the power button to be held for a specific duration to fully boot up, so restating this action ensures users don't rush through the initial power-on process. This methodical approach is characteristic of quality technical instructions.\n\nAdditionally, option B provides valuable troubleshooting information by noting that \"on some devices, the power switch may be located in the electronics section.\" This shows comprehensive consideration for different Kobo models and variations, helping users who might have difficulty locating their specific device's power button.\n\nThe structure of option B, with its main step followed by substeps, also matches the established formatting pattern of the instructions, maintaining consistency in the documentation style.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B.",

Allicin being identified as \"one of the four main antiviral compounds\" provides the biological mechanism that explains why the study participants who took garlic had significantly fewer cold occurrences.\n\nAdditionally, option A includes important symptom recognition information by noting that \"numbness and tingling of the affected body part\" is a common cold sign. This helps readers identify when they should consider using garlic treatment, making the advice actionable based on recognizable symptoms.\n\nThe other options either focus on consulting doctors (which interrupts the how-to format) or jump ahead to additional studies without first explaining the fundamental science behind why garlic works.

Since disability benefits are federal payments, it's essential that applicants understand their tax responsibilities - administrative workers involved in the process must handle federal and state income tax implications properly.\n\nThe mention of Social Security employees reporting wages to the SSA is particularly relevant because it establishes the official documentation trail that disability applicants need to be aware of. This wage reporting requirement ensures that all financial information is properly recorded, which is critical for determining benefit eligibility and amounts.\n\nThis completion logically follows the discussion of the blue book by transitioning into the practical administrative requirements that both applicants and the workers processing their claims must follow to ensure compliance with federal regulations.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B.",

Option D directly addresses this by emphasizing how lip balm creates a \"glowing\" effect, which is exactly what someone with dark lips would want to achieve - a brighter, more luminous look.\n\nThe mention of smoothing properties is particularly relevant because dark lips often appear uneven or rough in texture. By smoothing the lip surface, the lip balm helps create a more uniform appearance that naturally appears lighter and more attractive.\n\nThe plumping effect described in option D is crucial for lip lightening because fuller lips tend to have better blood circulation, which promotes healthier lip color. When lips are properly plumped and hydrated, they naturally appear more vibrant and less dark or dull.\n\nThe long-lasting nature mentioned (\"stays in your lips for a fair amount of time\") ensures continuous treatment, which is essential for addressing the underlying dryness that contributes to dark lip appearance. Consistent moisture without drying effects means the lips can maintain their improved appearance throughout the day.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D.",

These small details - like noticing what's on someone's desk during difficult times - show the deep level of care and attention that develops between close colleagues.\n\nThe second part, \"Or maybe you laid behind the desk feeling deeply over that person's work on the good days,\" captures the emotional investment and admiration you felt for this person's contributions. This demonstrates the profound workplace relationships that naturally lead to wanting to express heartfelt sentiments in a retirement card.\n\nThese examples provide the emotional foundation that would naturally guide someone toward selecting a more personal, sentimental card rather than something generic.

By highlighting these common uses, readers understand why choosing no-salt-added vegetables is particularly important for their overall sodium reduction goals.\n\nSecond, the specific instruction to search \"about halfway down the grocery aisle\" gives readers concrete, actionable guidance for their shopping experience. Most grocery stores follow similar layouts, and canned vegetables are typically located in the middle sections of aisles, making this a universally helpful tip that readers can immediately apply.\n\nThird, the instruction to search for \"no salt added\" in your pantry connects the grocery shopping advice back to organizing your existing food storage.

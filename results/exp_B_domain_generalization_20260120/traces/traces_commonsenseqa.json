Engineering is fundamentally about solving practical problems through the application of scientific and mathematical principles to design and build systems, structures, and devices.\n\nSecond, at the most basic level, all engineering work involves quantification and measurement. Whether you're calculating structural loads, determining electrical currents, analyzing fluid dynamics, or designing chemical processes, everything in engineering comes down to working with numbers and quantities.\n\nThird, while mathematics is certainly important in engineering, the question asks what a student \"must\" do - implying the most fundamental requirement. Before you can even begin to understand complex mathematical concepts like calculus, differential equations, or linear algebra, you must first have the basic ability to count and work with numbers.\n\nFourth, counting is the foundation that underlies all other mathematical operations.

Coastal farming is common in many regions, where farmers might grow salt-tolerant crops or raise livestock near oceanfront properties.\n\nFourth, if a farmer is working land near a coastal area, it would be perfectly reasonable for them to encounter wooded sections adjacent to beach areas.

This evolutionary mechanism is designed to optimize physical capabilities when facing challenges or threats.\n\nThis activation causes several key changes: increased heart rate to pump more blood to muscles, enhanced oxygen delivery through faster breathing, and the release of performance-enhancing hormones like adrenaline and cortisol. These hormones sharpen focus and increase strength and speed.\n\nThe body also redirects blood flow away from non-essential functions and toward the muscles that are actively engaged in the competition. This redistribution ensures that the most important muscle groups receive maximum fuel and oxygen.\n\nAll of these physiological adaptations work together toward one primary goal: enabling the body to function at a higher level than it normally would during rest or casual activity. The body essentially shifts into an enhanced performance mode.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B.",

During daytime, the sky appears mostly uniform blue due to light scattering, which limits the visual interest and complexity we can observe.\n\nAt night, however, the sky transforms dramatically. Without the sun's overwhelming brightness washing out other celestial objects, we can see stars, constellations, planets, and sometimes the Milky Way galaxy stretching across the darkness. This creates a rich tapestry of lights against the deep black backdrop.\n\nAdditionally, nighttime often provides the clearest atmospheric conditions for sky viewing, as thermal currents from daytime heating have settled down, reducing atmospheric disturbance that can blur our view of celestial objects.\n\nThe other options like \"outdoors,\" \"atmosphere,\" and \"planetarium\" describe locations or mediums for viewing the sky, but they don't specify the optimal timing conditions. \"Photo\" refers to a reproduction rather than direct experience.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D.",

So we can write: (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28\n\n**Step 5:** Simplifying the equation from Step 4: B + 2 + S + 2 = 28, which gives us B + S + 4 = 28\n\n**Step 6:** Subtracting 4 from both sides: B + S = 24\n\n**Step 7:** Now I'll substitute S = 2B from Step 2 into this equation: B + 2B = 24, which simplifies to 3B = 24\n\n**Step 8:** Solving for B: B = 24 ÷ 3 = 8, so Brooke is currently 8 years old.\n\n**Step 9:** Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's age is: S = 2 × 8 = 16\n\nWait, let me double-check this by considering that Seth will be 11 in 2 years, so he must be 9 now. If Seth is 9 and twice Brooke's age, then Brooke is 4.5. In 2 years: Seth will be 11 and Brooke will be 6.5, giving us 11 + 6.5 = 17.5... Let me recalculate.\n\nActually, if we work backwards from Seth being 11 in 2 years, then Seth is currently 9. Since Seth is twice Brooke's age, Brooke must be 4.5 currently. But since we're dealing with whole numbers for ages, Brooke is approximately 4 or 5. Taking Brooke as 5, then in 2 years the sum would be 11 + 7 = 18.

So that's 3 × $1.00 = $3.00.\n\n**Step 3:** For the last 2 teeth, Sharon received half the amount per tooth as she had received for each of the previous three teeth. Since she received $1.00 per tooth for the previous three teeth, half of that amount is $1.00 ÷ 2 = $0.50 per tooth.\n\n**Step 4:** So for the last 2 teeth, Sharon received 2 × $0.50 = $1.00 total.\n\n**Step 5:** Now I need to add up all the money Sharon received:\n- First tooth: $5.00\n- Next three teeth: $3.00\n- Last two teeth: $1.00\n\n**Step 6:** Total amount = $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00\n\n**Step 7:** Wait, let me double-check the last calculation.

So we can write: (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28\n\n**Step 5:** Simplifying the equation from Step 4: B + 2 + S + 2 = 28, which gives us B + S + 4 = 28\n\n**Step 6:** Subtracting 4 from both sides: B + S = 24\n\n**Step 7:** Now I'll substitute S = 2B from Step 2 into this equation: B + 2B = 24, which simplifies to 3B = 24\n\n**Step 8:** Solving for B: B = 24 ÷ 3 = 8, so Brooke is currently 8 years old.\n\n**Step 9:** Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's age is: S = 2 × 8 = 16\n\nWait, let me double-check this by considering that Seth will be 11 in 2 years, so he must be 9 now. If Seth is 9 and twice Brooke's age, then Brooke is 4.5. In 2 years: Seth will be 11 and Brooke will be 6.5, giving us 11 + 6.5 = 17.5... Let me recalculate.\n\nActually, if we work backwards from Seth being 11 in 2 years, then Seth is currently 9. Since Seth is twice Brooke's age, Brooke must be 4.5 currently. But since we're dealing with whole numbers for ages, Brooke is approximately 4 or 5. Taking Brooke as 5, then in 2 years the sum would be 11 + 7 = 18.

    "trace": "I'll solve this step-by-step.\n\n**Step 1: Determine how far Aaron ran**\nSince Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, and Vanessa ran 4 miles:\nAaron's distance = 4 miles ÷ 2 = 2 miles\n\n**Step 2: Find Aaron's speed**\nAaron completed 2 miles in 16 minutes\nAaron's speed = 2 miles ÷ 16 minutes = 0.125 miles per minute\n\n**Step 3: Find Vanessa's speed**\nThe problem states that Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa\nSo Vanessa's speed = Aaron's speed ÷ 2 = 0.125 ÷ 2 = 0.0625 miles per minute\n\n**Step 4: Calculate Vanessa's time**\nVanessa ran 4 miles at 0.0625 miles per minute\nTime = Distance ÷ Speed = 4 miles ÷ 0.0625 miles per minute = 32 minutes\n\nWait, let me double-check this calculation:\n4 ÷ 0.0625 = 4 × 16 = 64 minutes\n\nActually, let me recalculate more carefully:\nIf Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, and Aaron's speed is 0.125 miles per minute, then Vanessa's speed should be 0.125 ÷ 2 = 0.0625 miles per minute.\n\nTime for Vanessa = 4 miles ÷ 0.0625 miles per minute = 4 × 15 = 60 minutes\n\nTherefore, the answer is 60.",
